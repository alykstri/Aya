# Aya
Aya is a chess bot that is under development, intended to increase my knowledge in Java and perhaps other closely associated languages. It is not meant for general public use, and should never be used against anyone without their knowledge, on any platform. Chess.com and lichess.org both, I believe, currently ban for using an engine in unrated games and I accept no liability for anyone who does feel harmed after misusing my engine.

The story behind the name will come some other time, after the name has a little bit of respect. Knowing me, this project probably won't get that far.
